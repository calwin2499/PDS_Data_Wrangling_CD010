# PDSDataWrangling

Data Wrangling: It prepares raw-data for analysis.
This process involves discovering, cleaning and reformatting, restructuring/reshaping,
enriching and validating data.

1. Discovering
   
(i) Read in the Crop_Production data from the csv file. Write code to list all column
names that have trailing or leading spaces, check for inconsistent spellings or
capitalization in categorical columns values like 'District'
Hints:
● df.info/columns
● df[‘col’].unique

(ii) Find the top 5 highest 'Yield' crops on average across the entire dataset.
Hints:
● df.groupby:Splitting, Applying, and Combining.
● mean(), sort_values(), head()

(iii) Find all crop names ('Crop') that appear fewer than 300 times in the entire dataset.
Hints:
● value_count()

2.Structuring

(i) Rename all column names that have trailing or leading spaces
Hints:
● df.rename(columns={oldname,newname})

(ii) What is the seasonal performance of each crop, in terms of both total Production and
average Yield
Hints:
● df.groupby a list of column names
● agg(): apply one or more aggregation functions to one or more columns,

(iii) What is the year-wise total production for each crop
Hints:
● df.pivot(): transform a DataFrame from a "long" format to a "wide" format
Arguments: index, columns, and values.

(iv) Which crop, in which year, produced the highest average yield
Hints:
● df.melt(): transform or reshape DataFrames from a "wide" format to a "long"
format.
Arguments: id_vars, value_vars, var_name, value_name
[use transformed data from pivot)

3. Cleaning
   
(i) Change inconsistent columns values like 'State' and 'District' from uppercase to
lowercase and remove trailing or leading spaces
Hints:
● df[‘col’].str.lower(), df[‘col’].str.strip()

(ii) Instead of filling missing Production with 0 or a global mean, impute the NaN values
by calculating Area * (Average_Yield). The Average_Yield should be the average for
that specific District and Crop combination.
Hints:
● groupby(['District', 'Crop']), transform('mean'), and fillna()).

(iii) Find the wheat production of Odisha state
Hints:
● filter by Multiple Conditions (AND - &)

4. Enrichment
   
(i) Merge with External Data
Hints:
● df.merge(data1,data2)
Check whether common column and its values are compatible or not before
merge

(ii) Create new column {Pollutant ratios} derived from existing columns {SO2,NOx}
Hints:
● df[new_col]= derived formula
Pollutant ratios= SO2/NOx

5. Validating
   
(i) The Yield column should equal Production / Area. Create a new column called
Calculated_Yield using this formula. Then, find the sum of the difference between
Calculated_Yield and Yield to see if the original data was accurate.

(ii) Check if any Area, Production, or Yield values are negative.
Check if Production > 0 and Area == 0
Check if any Crop_Year is in the future (e.g., > 2024).
